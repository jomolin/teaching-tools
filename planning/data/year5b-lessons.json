Throughout the remainder of the master section, spend some time investigating the different possible locations of point C. Master goes on to illustrate one possibility for each triangle. There are multiple possibilities (some of which are difficult to find) but the main purpose is to practise using coordinates to describe position. Start with the right-angled triangle. Where could C be positioned to make a right angle at C? You might need to suggest a few points (using coordinates) and ask students whether it forms a right-angled triangle. Remember that the main focus today is on using coordinates.\nRepeat a similar process for the other two triangles, asking students where they think point C could be positioned. For the isosceles triangle, the three possibilities are that AC has the same length as AB, BC has the same length as AB, or that AC and BC have the same length. Only the latter of these fits on the grid.\nDuring Guided Practice, students are plotting points and writing the coordinates of the vertices of a parallelogram.", "formative_assessment": ["use coordinates to plot points.", "connect points to make a triangle or quadrilateral.", "explain what each number in a coordinate represents."], "content_priority": "This is a key lesson.\nLearning Outcomes\nPupils mark the position of points, specified by coordinates in the first quadrant of a coordinate grid, and write coordinates for already-marked points.", "textbook_url": "https://hub.mathsnoproblem.com/teacher-guides/new-zealand-whakawhitinga-edition/textbook-5b/chapter-13/lesson-1"}, {"content_type": "worksheet", "textbook_chapter": "13", "textbook_lesson": "2", "workbook_pages": "125 - 126", "workbook_url": "https://hub.mathsnoproblem.com/teacher-guides/new-zealand-whakawhitinga-edition/workbook-5b/chapter-13/worksheet-2", "textbook_pages": "165 - 169", "objective": "describe translations accurately.", "approach": "To begin this lesson, show students the Explore task and ask them to help you find the coordinates of J and its counterpart in the purple parallelogram. How do the coordinates change? Would the coordinates of K, L and M move in the same way? How can we describe the overall movement of the shape? Guide the class to see that parallelogram JKLM moves 5 units to the right and specifically, that all of its vertices move 5 coordinates to the right. Then ask students to work in pairs and give them some time to determine the movements to the pink and blue shapes.\nWork through Master 1, which illustrates the first movement of 5 units to the right. Ideally, provide the class with square grid paper and a copy of the parallelogram on the same scale as the grid. Ask them to plot parallelogram JKLM on their grid, place the paper parallelogram over it, and then slide it 5 units to the right.
