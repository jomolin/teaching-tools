Remind students of the value of the digit in the hundreds place and the significance of the zeros in the tens and ones place when reading and writing hundreds.\nShow students the Explore task. Count up in hundreds while either pointing at the jars of marbles or using sets of 100 until you get to 1000. Count backwards in hundreds from 1000 to zero.

What value does the car park bar represent? So how can we work out the value of the road bar? It is twice as big as the car park bar: 17 \u00d7 2. How can we multiply 17 by 2?

Holly wrapped 4 presents by using the same amount of wrapping paper, so how can we show this using the bars? She had 44 cm of wrapping paper left, so altogether she had the amount needed to wrap the 4 presents (the 4 bars) and an additional 44 cm.

The 4 bars must be 140 cm \u2013 44 cm = 96 cm. This is because 44 added to 96 gives a total of 140 cm. So, if the 4 bars are equal to 96 cm, how can we work out what 1 bar is equal to?

What key information is given? What do we need to know before we can find the solution? Gather students' opinions and ask them questions so that everyone can understand each others' thinking.\nRefer to Master. How can we represent the problem using a bar model? Sam makes 3 meals and uses the same amount of rice for each one. He has 13 g of rice left. What can we do to show how he used the rice and how much he had left? We can draw a part\u2013whole bar model to represent what he used and what was left. Altogether he had 100 g of rice; how much did he use for the 3 meals? How can we work this out? 100 \u2013 13. So he must have used 87 g on the 3 meals as 87 g + 13 g gives us 100 g, which is the amount he began with. How can we work out how much rice he used for each meal? We can divide 87 by 3 since he used the same amount of rice for each. How can we easily divide 87 by 3? We can think of 87 as 60 and 27 and show this in a part-whole model. We know 60 divided by 3 is 20 and 27 divided by 3 is 9, therefore 87 \u00f7 3 must be 20 + 9 = 29. So, Sam used 29 g of rice for each meal.\nRemind students they can check the division calculation using multiplication.\nDuring Guided Practice, students are using bar models to solve complex word problems.
